* clojure-training-2025

A set of training materials adapted from Alain Picard's clojure training resources prepared by Benson Zhang for use in training new clojure engineers.

* How to use this repo

*PREPARING*

Before each lesson, you /must/ come prepared by having
completed the necessary reading in each of the lesson plans (located in docs).
Make sure you keep an eye on this repo for new lesson plans,
and I will post on discord each time a new one is added.

*DURING THE LESSONS*

This repo will periodically be updated with the code developed in
each lesson (when applicable) so you can download and play with the
examples I provide during the lessons.
After each lesson, the code will be added in a
file (or subdirectory) named =lesson-01=, =lesson-02= /etc./ (in the src subdir).

*AFTER THE LESSONS*

You will have to *fork* this repo so you can submit your *assignment solutions*
for review.

At the end of the lesson, I will sometimes set assignments
which I will detail in the assignments section.  You should
attempt to answer these, placing your answers in the file
=/src/assignments/your_name//lesson_XX_answers.clj=.  When you
can cleanly load your file into a repl, raise a *pull request* for
me to review your code and merge it back into the main repo.  Thus,
you'll be able to view your colleague's solutions after I merge your
answers back into the main repo.

*REVIEWING SOLUTIONS*

After the lessons, I will place my solutions in [[file:src/assignments/benson/][this directory]]. You
can peruse them at your leisure and compare against the code
you have written.

I will also place the code I present during the live coding
sessions [[file:src/clojure_training_2025/][in here]]; the files beginning with live_XXX are the code
you see on the screen during the presentation; the files without the
live_ prefix are the preparatory material I produce (which is close,
but doesn't include the tangents I go off on during the lessons as
questions arise, /etc./)

 * Resources

We are going to make extensive use of the following:

 - The excellent online book: [[https://www.braveclojure.com/clojure-for-the-brave-and-true/][Clojure for the Brave and True]]
 - The [[https://github.com/functional-koans/clojure-koans][clojure koans]]
 - Many of the excellent at [[https://4clojure.oxal.org/][4clojure sample problems]]
 - In lessons 7 and 8, we will make use of this simple server playground (TODO).
 - In lessons 9 and 10, we will study a bit of reagent (TODO)
 - In lessons 11 and 12, we will build our own version of the [[https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee][New York Times Spelling Bee]].

* Assignments
These will be added in over time as lessons are completed.
Assignment answers should be committed in src/assignments/YOUR_NAME/assignmentXX.clj in your forked branch
Pull this branch separately, and merge it into your source branch, commit, and raise a pull request to the main branch.

** Lesson 1
These are the assignment problems following Lesson 1.
We will discuss your solutions and see my solutions
at the beginning of [[file:doc/lesson-02.org::*Lesson%20Goals][Lesson 2]].

NOTE: To solve the problems on 4clojure, simply copy the code and paste it into 4clojure and click run to test your solution.

1. Explain the differences between list and vector, show examples and usages
2. Problem https://4clojure.oxal.org/#/problem/20
3. Problem https://4clojure.oxal.org/#/problem/24 
4. Problem https://4clojure.oxal.org/#/problem/38 (No using max)
5. Create a function that returns a histogram of the amount of letters in a string.
   e.g. "Hello" returns some data structure that indicates there is 1 'H', 1 'e', 2 'l', 1 'o'
   Do it without using (frequencies...)

Bonus
For those feeling brave, try to write a function which solves this problem:
https://4clojure.oxal.org/#/problem/77 I will provide my solution to compare with you at the next lecture.

** Lesson 2
   These are the assignment problems following Lesson 2.
   We will discuss your solutions and see my solutions
   at the beginning of [[file:doc/lesson-03.org::*Lesson%20Goals][Lesson 3]].

   1. Implement your own version of =filter= using a loop form, then using reduce.
   2. Implement your own version of =update-in=
   3. Write a function which solves this problem:
      https://4clojure.oxal.org/#/problem/77
   4. Write a function which solves this problem:
      https://4clojure.oxal.org/#/problem/53
